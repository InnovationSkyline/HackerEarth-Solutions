#Sum of N

##This is a solution to HackerEarth problem. Following steps are followed:

*First, we take the size of the array as input (N).
*Then, the array is declared to be of integer type.
*The space separated array elements are taken as input from user.
*An integer type variable is declared and initialised with value 0 as no array element is added yet.
*Now, a for loop is used to read each element starting from index 0 to N-1 and are simultaneously added to previous value of sum and array element present at that particular loop index.
*Lastly, the variable sum which contains the final answer is printed as the output.
