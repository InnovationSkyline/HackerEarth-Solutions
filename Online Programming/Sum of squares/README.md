# SUM OF SQUARES OF ARRAY OF SIZE N

## Following steps are followed:

- First, we take the size of the array as input (N).

- Then, the array is declared to be of integer type.

- The space separated array elements are taken as input from user.

- An integer type variable called *sum* is declared and initialised with value 0 as no array element is added yet.

- Now, a for loop is used to read each element starting from index 0 to N-1 and are simultaneously added to previous value of sum and array element present at that particular loop index is added two times.

- Lastly, the variable sum which contains the final answer is printed as the output.
