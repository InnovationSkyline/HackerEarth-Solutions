#SUM OF SQUARES OF ARRAY OF SIZE N

###Following steps are followed:

1. First, we take the size of the array as input (N).

2. Then, the array is declared to be of integer type.

3. The space separated array elements are taken as input from user.

4. An integer type variable called *sum* is declared and initialised with value 0 as no array element is added yet.

5. Now, a for loop is used to read each element starting from index 0 to N-1 and are simultaneously added to previous value of sum and array element present at that particular loop index is added two times.

6. Lastly, the variable sum which contains the final answer is printed as the output.
