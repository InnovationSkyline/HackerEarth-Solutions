# ADD TWO ARRAYS OF SIZE N

## This is a problem for beginners who are just starting with array input output and learning operations on arrays. Following steps are followed:

- First, we take the size of the array as input (N).

- Then, the array 1, array 2, and sum array are declared to be of integer type and of size N.

- The space separated elements of array 1 are taken as input from user.

- The space separated elements of array 2 are taken as input from user.

- Now, a for loop is used to read each elements of both array 1 and array 2 starting from index 0 to N-1.  Both the arrays are simultaneously added and eaquated to sum array of same index starting from 0 to N-1. <br/> i.e. sum[0] = array1[0] + array2[0] <br/> sum[1] = array1[1] + array2[1]... and so on.

- Lastly, the array sum which contains the final answer is printed as the output using another for loop starting from index 0 to N-1.
